## Conclusion 
The project was tough, and it was challenging, there were parts when I didn't  even understand what's happening and why(  getDocumentsDirectory()).  
I'm finding this project helpful to understand basics of working with Collection view and view cells.  
Look forward to get back and make this app even better.
